I wanted a way to quickly and easily save book information, my 5-star rating, and external links out to the book and its resources to save for my own future and personal reference.\r\n\r\nThe primary functionality of this plugin is to store book (or product) information in a Custom Meta Box beneath your Post editor (in the back-end) that will then be displayed in its own \"ratings ID card\" at the top of your Post (in the front-end). \r\n\r\nBest of all: This plugin allows you to quickly input all the relevant information and links related to your review and have those *consistently* display in the same (responsive) format in your Posts without you ever needing to worry about styling \r\nor formatting the review boxes yourself. This allows you to spend more time writing the review itself and less time worrying about the display of your review.\r\n\r\nIn short: This plugin makes writing reviews fun and simple as the styling is all \r\ntaken care of for you.\r\n\r\nRequires WordPress 3.5 and PHP 5.\r\n\r\n###Special Features\r\n* Multiple Review Types supported\r\n* [FontAwesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) icons\r\n* Range slider to select your rating\r\n* Uses WordPress's native Image Chooser to add a Cover Image\r\n* Responsive design (front-end and back-end)\r\n* Affiliate link support\r\n* Ability to enable or disable Affiliate link disclaimer\r\n\r\n###Information Stored by the Plugin \r\n* The Title\r\n* Author name\r\n* Cover image\r\n* Category\r\n* Book Series\r\n* Star-rating\r\n* Summary\r\n* External links\r\n * Affiliate/Product purchase link\r\n * The Book's homepage\r\n * The author's homepage\r\n * The book resources page \r\n\r\n###Reviews Types supported \r\n* Book\r\n* Audio\r\n* Video\r\n* Course\r\n* Product\r\n* Service\r\n* Other\r\n\r\n###Planned Upcoming Features\r\n* Custom Post Type\r\n* Custom Taxonomy\r\n* Shortcode\r\n* Parameters `big` and `small` to change the display box features\r\n* Custom colors or additional box styles\r\n* Override (optional) the Post Featured Image with the Cover Image you choose\r\n* Overlay Star-ratings over the Featured Image on index pages\r\n* WordPress Options page\r\n* CSS animations\r\n* Dropdown menu to select different icons for external links or Review Type\r\n* Translations\r\n* (More ideas?
